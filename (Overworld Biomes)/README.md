# Overview
(Overworld Biomes) aims to completely overhaul the vanilla Minecraft biomes to breathe new life into the relatively basic environments. It also aims to add fresh, new biomes to fill in some of the gaps, as there are many environments that go unrepresented. However, these biomes should still have a balance of looking nice while still being fun and easy to traverse, collect resources, and build in.

Along with changing biomes, animal spawns should also be reworked, in order to make local animals better match real life. Maybe farm animals *don't* exist in every conceivable biome?
# General Changes
- Wandering Traders sell biome maps
- Streams that go *through* biomes, rather than around
## Plants
- Allow Sugarcane to be bonemealed
- Bonemealing flowers grows more of that flower
- Make Red Mushrooms poisonous

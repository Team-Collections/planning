# Logic
- Randomizer, which will continuously output a random signal strength between 0 and 15 when receiving an input [^1]
- Logic Gate blocks (AND, OR, XOR, etc)
	- This will (hopefully) help immensely with compacting computational circuits and making computational Redstone much more approachable
- Addition and Subtraction blocks
	- Comparators already have a subtract mode, but there's currently no explicit functionality for adding signal strengths. Also, it's a bit weird that Comparators *also* subtract.
- Relay, which re-emits the signal strength of the block it's looking at

# Variants
For each wood type, there will be variants for every wood-related block and item. For the primary blocks (logs, planks, etc), each will have every shape variant (stairs, slabs, fences, etc). There will also be a set of "special" blocks, that have no block or shape variants, and are one per wood set (chests, crafting tables, doors, etc).

> For example, Oak Planks, Oak Logs, and Oak Mosaics will all have stairs, slabs, and other shape variants. But, Oak Chests won't have any kind of variants.
## Wood Types
For every wood type, there will be a new type of tree, coming with leaves and saplings. However, they don't need to actually be placed in world gen, as that will be up to [[! (Overworld Biomes)|Overworld Biomes]] to handle.
